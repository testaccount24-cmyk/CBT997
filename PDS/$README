========================= RELEASE INFORMATION =============================


zIGI is the open source z/OS ISPF Git Interface application that enables
the traditional ISPF user to utilize many of the facilities of Git without
having to "fully" learn Git while avoiding the need to use the OMVS
environment.

To get started with this package:

1. Install Git for OMVS via the great folks at Rocket Software
1a. Go to this url for Git and the pre-requisite tools (bash, gzip,
    and perl):
    https://www.rocketsoftware.com/product-categories/mainframe/git-for-zos
1b. Go to this url to get a simplified installer for Git and the
    pre-requisite tools:
    https://gist.github.com/wizardofzos/897b243d4cbe9fbc471ec1396fbbe174
1c. Now install Git using the installer
2. Make sure Git-related setups (PATH/LIB etc.) is set via
   /etc/profile
3. Create an account at github.com and add your SSH public key to it.
4. From OMVS-shell invoke: git clone git@github.com/zigi/zigi.git
5. cd zigi
6. ./install.sh (su and MVS HLQ access might be required)
7. ISPF,3.4. Go to ZIGI.EXEC and exec ZIGI

Note: that if the repository was downloaded from GitHub as a zip file
rather than doing a git clone operation that the file attributes may not
be accurate. These are resolved by the zginstall.rex which will detect
this and call the zgcvtenc.awk routine to resolve the file attributes by
changing them from iso8859-1 to ibm1047 prior to creating the z/OS
datasets.
