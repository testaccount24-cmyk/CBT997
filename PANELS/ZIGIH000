+
%Getting Started:+
+
%ZIGI+is designed to make working with%Git+very easy for the ISPF developer, but
+you should still have a basic understanding of%Git+and how your organization
+uses it. While you can use it solely with open source tools found on GitHub
+and other%Git+sites, the most cost effective use is to use it as a free
+distributed version control system (VCS) for source code management (SCM).
+
+The%ZIGI+Local Repositories Panel is where you find a table of all%Git+
+repositories that you have cloned or created. It is also the place where you
+can easily Clone an existing repository or Create a new repository.
