+
+The ZIGI application has been designed to support the traditional
+ISPF Panel navigation by entering the desired commands and table row
+selections. It has also been designed to support%point-and-shoot+fields
+for use by those more comfortable with that approach. All point-and-shoot
+fields are underlined for easy identification.
+
+Enabling%Tab to Point-and-Shoot fields+in the ISPF Settings (option 0 on
+the ISPF Primary Menu) makes these fields easier to use with both the
+keyboard and mouse.
+
+Use the keyboard Tab key, or newline key, to move to the point-and-shoot fields
+and then just press the%Enter+key to execute that command or table row
+selection.
+
+
+
          +Press the%Enter+key to continue your ZIGI tutorial journey.
