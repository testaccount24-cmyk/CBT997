+ZIGI has been updated to support the use of the%Dovetailed Technologies+
%Co:Z Co-Processing Toolkit%getpds+and%putpds+commands that are used to
+replace the OMVS%cp+command.
+
+The advantage of using these commands is speed. The%cp+command is much slower,
+especially with partitioned datasets with a large number of members.
+
%Co:Z+is available at no charge under their Community License. They do offer
+an Enterprise License that includes 24x7 support.
+
+Included in the toolkit is an improved%sftp+for OMVS that supports z/OS
+datasets and a%Co:Z Batch+that can replace the use of IBM's BPXBATCH utility.
+
+Note that when%Co:Z+is installed and available that ZIGI will indicate that
+on the ZIGI Local Repositories panel and on the Current Repository panel.
