                               %Starting ZIGI
+
+Starting%ZIGI+is easy. If the sample startup stub has been installed then all
+that is required is to issue the command%TSO ZIGI+from any ISPF panel.
+
+If the bypass option on the splash panel has been enabled (using Y) and you
+wish to see the splash panel again, then the command would be %TSO ZIGI S+to
%start zigi.
+
+Starting with%/ENV+will force the Git Environment Prompt. Or%/ENVR+to nullify.
+
+If you know the name of a specific repository you want to start with then
+the command would be%TSO ZIGI repository-name+and ZIGI opens that
+repository and bypasses the Local Repository table.
