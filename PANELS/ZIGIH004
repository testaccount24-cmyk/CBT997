+
%ZIGI+is designed provide an easy to use ISPF interface to local and
+remote Git repositories. It is%not+designed to be a full application
+development environment - there are better tools for that available in native
+ISPF, open source ISPF tools, and vendor tools.
+
%ZIGI+is; however designed to make it easy to be the easy interface to Git for
+source code version control for your application development team.
+
+It is recommended that each team working with%ZIGI+develop a plan on how to
+use it. This is no different from the plan on how teams are to use any SCM.
+
%Note+each developer should work with their own local repository and then
+commit and push updates to the remote repository.
